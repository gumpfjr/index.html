          <p class="lead">Here is an overview of my look into the issues with the Quizlet application and how UX design can help fix the issue.</p>
    <p>As the technological age has progressed, so has the ability to create content and applications that can be used on our smart phones. The popularity of mobile apps has created more competition and higher standars when it comes to creating an app. A deeper understanding of the inner workings of UX or user interface design is necessary in order to create an app that appeals to the public, is useful, and is coded and created with accuracy and precisoun for the user.</p>

          <h2>About Quizlet</h2>
          <p class="lead">Quizlet is an app that was created as a study aid for people. This application is usually used by the student/teacher population, but it is open to anyone lookin to learn more about a certain topic. It is a web-based application that was devloped to allow students and teachers to master there learning.</p>
            <P><strong>These are the features included in the Quizlet mobile application and desktop:</strong></P>
            <ul>
                <li>Flashcard Tool</li>
                <li>Learn Tool</li>
                <li>New Quizlet learning Assistant</li>
                <li>Write/Spell Tool</li>
                <li>Flashcard Tool</li>

        <p><strong>Quizlet App Analysis</strong></p>
            <p>As shown by the above two images Quizlet is an easy app to navigate. There are only a few tabs which lead to your personal profile, your classrooms, your study sets, and then the main page dedicated to learning the material.</p>
            <p>Most individuals find the app easy to use and dont need alot of assistance naviagting it because it is user friendly already. The main improvement based off the User input will be the fact checker attachment to prove the accuracy of the given card information.</p>

          <h2>Design Problem Statement</h2>
          <p class="lead">Based off of the two surveys sent out to the participants (as seen below) its clear there are pros and cons to the Quizlet. The responses show that the users enjoy the applications learning tools and the flashcard tool. It can also be concluded that the main pain point for this application is that users would like an improvment for the knowledge and information within the app. This basically means that users would like a fact checker feature that will allow the users to know the information they're learning is accuarte and not false information.</p>
          <p><strong>Design Question:</strong> Out of the following issues with the Quizlet application, which needs to be improved upon?</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p class="lead">Here are the compiled answers from the two surveys I sent out to my fellow JMU students. I created two Google form surveys and sent them out and recieved back 20 answers for each survey. The results are presented in pie chart format showing the percentages nect to each answer.</p>
            <p><strong>What's your favorite feature for the Quizlet application?</strong></p>
            <img src="survey%201.png" alt="What's your favorite feature for the Quizlet application?" height="350" width="475">
            <p>This survey introduced the Quizlet app and asked the question to the users, what there favorite feature of the app was.</p>
            <p>This question allows for the user to look at the positive or pros of the app before looking at the cons or the flaw of the app. This was there is a more open minded outlook when discussing the apps's issues.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Out of the following issues with the Quizlet application, which needs to be improved upon?</strong></p>
            <img src="survey%202.png" alt="Out of the following issues with the Quizlet application, which needs to be approved upon?" height="350" width="475">
            <p>This question allows the user to view the application through a more critical lens and discuss the major flaws of the app. This feedback can then translate into productive change for the devlopment of the app for the user.</p>
            <p>The majority of users decided that the main issue is the issue of publishing study sets without having them be properly fact checked. When using Quizlet there is no function that checks to see if the nformation provided is true or not. Therefore there is the potntial issue that users may be consuming incorrect information from time to time.</p>

    <section id="Solution">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
          <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The feedback from the survyed individuals revealed alot about the app, with what works and what needs improvement. After looking at the surveys and comparing the original app design with the potential changes there are a few major changes that can be made.</p>
            <p>The users enjoy the various types of information that can be obsobed through the different modes of studying. There are already multiple options in that . design area, so for this specific "pain point" the focus will be on the fact checker function.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><strong>Fact Checker Improvment</strong></p>
            <p>The fact checker function would be created by Quizlet so it can be monitored and updated by them. The main fucntion of this checker is to check the factul accuracy of the information in these learning sets. This function will only be in use if the individual chooses to make there learning set free to the public, otherwise any individual sets will be left alone.</p>
            <p>Having Quizlet be incharge of this function allows for the user to trust the results of the fact check because the company will be liable. This will also ensure that the knowledge being shared through this app is accurate, the best it can be, and organized in the most streamline way possible.</p>
